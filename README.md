# rusty-rustup

This project contains my musings and my attempt to get rusty with rust.

I've generally admired it as a language and feel it's about time I got to grips with it.

## Interesting Things to note



## Setting up your environment



## Creating your first project
In creating your first project, you'll need to use 'cargo', rust's package manager. Most times it comes pre-installed with your rust installation.

- Create a new project
```bash
cargo new hello_world
```

- Build your project
```bash
cargo build
```

- Run your project
```bash
cargo run
```
